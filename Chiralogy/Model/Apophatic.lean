/-! # Model: the apophatic model (skeleton and base)

Generic over an `AbsenceStructure` (a value space with an `absent` predicate): the collision
(`boundary_collision`) and the two moves (`totalization_exists`, `partialization_exists`) hold from the
predicate alone, the moves crossing at the absence-locus whose cardinality is an instance fact. Maybe is the
distinguished base (`maybeAbsence`, `singular_absence`, `base_embeds_out`), free by `maybe_free_pointed`, out
of which the tower levels (`Model/Apophatic/Instances.lean`) embed. The base's concrete facts follow.

The canonical extension `Kl(Maybe)`: keep-the-none. `Option` is the monad; `payload_survives` and
`maybe_free_pointed` characterize the free adjunction of one absence; `imprecise_is_partial_mode` occupies
the partial pole. The two cost-inverted moves are `totalization` (fill the none, target-free cost) and
`partialization` (open one, target-dependent), with `totalization_irreversible` the non-invertible move. The
none-chiasm: the two arms invert at the none (`model_arms_invert`), whose center is distinct from the kernel
hole (`model_center_is_the_none`).

READING (a reading, not a theorem): the model reads coalgebraically, keeping a none as a way of failing to
produce rather than a value returned; the algebra presents an observational content, the arm's dress not its
substance. This is the arm's flavour, a characterization; the algebra/coalgebra duality for a shared functor is
refuted, the cataphatic arm being no single `Alg F` and `F X = X → B` contravariant. -/

tower's shape-claims (singular center, binary boundary, no ranking) rest on this; structured absence breaks
it. -/

/-- **The base is minimal on every coordinate.** Maybe has one absent value (all absent values equal) and one
nullary generator (the absence is the single constant `none`, the range of `fun _ => none`), hence unmarked
with reason count equal to value count, no dependence, and no grouping choice: at one absence the partition is
forced. This is `maybe_free_pointed` seen from the index, the free theory on exactly one constant. -/

/-! ## The moves on distinction

What totalization and partialization do to the distinctions between rows, scale-independently. A distinction
between two rows is present-carried when they differ at a pair where both return present verdicts, absence-carried
when they differ only where one abstains. The survival and monotonicity facts are universal; the move-duality they
frame is witnessed.

READING (a reading, not a theorem): the two moves destroy dual kinds of distinction. Totalization removes absences,
so it destroys absence-carried distinctions while preserving present-carried ones (`survives_totalization`, a
universal theorem: a present-carried distinction survives totalization under every scale). Partialization removes
present verdicts, so it destroys present-carried distinctions at the opened pair while a column-uniform opening
never separates equal rows (`opening_is_monotone_on_distinction`, a universal theorem: separation comes from the
mask, never from the parameterless absence fill). The duality itself is witnessed, not proven general: one
present-carried distinction survives totalization yet dies when its column is opened
(`opening_destroys_present_carried`, a Fin 2 witness), and dually one absence-carried distinction merges under
totalization (`totalization_destroys_absence_carried`, a Fin 2 witness). So the survival and monotonicity are
universal, the crossing duality witnessed, the same honesty as the assemblage's floor-universal, ceiling-witnessed
bounds. -/

/-! ### Fragility: the absence-carried measure of a classification

A distinction between two rows is absence-carried when the rows differ but no column has both present, so
`totalization` merges them (the complement, among distinct pairs, of `presentCarried`, which `survives_totalization`
keeps). `fragility` counts the absence-carried distinct ordered row-pairs; `distinctRows` counts all distinct
ordered row-pairs. The coordinate `fragility / distinctRows` is the scale-independent measure of how absence-carried
a classification's distinctions are, in `[0,1]`, well-defined exactly when `c` is non-degenerate (some rows differ).
The raw count is scale-relative (the saturated family gives `n^2 - n`); the normalization by the state-dependent
denominator is what makes it scale-independent. The two boundary theorems characterize the extremes; parity gives
the artifact-free integer `fragility / 2`. -/
